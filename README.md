# garden-shed
eCommerce app developed with Android Jetpack and Kotlin

This is my first mobile application. Garden Shed is a simple application for buying products from a remote data source. Main functionalities include:
- Display products from fakestoreapi.com
- Add products to cart and change the quantity
- Create a profile 
- Display a new special offer every 24 hours

This project served as the basis for my learning Kotlin and Android Jetpack extensions including:
- Room DB
- Retrofit
- Coroutines
- MVVM Clean Architecture
- Dagger Hilt
- Work Manager
- Navigation Component
- Android Accessibility features

Please fork this project or contact me with any ways you think it could be improved!
